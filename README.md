### Abstract
COVENTS is an app providing easy access to virtual events happening around the globe in the era of COVID-19. Our goal is to help preserve a sense of togetherness while social distancing through live entertainment. Upon opening the app, the user is able to view upcoming events gathered by a webscraper and compiled into a single API. The user can favorite events as they browse. Favorited events populate in a section of the nav bar on the left so the user has easy access to the event name, date, and a link to the external details page for that event. The user is also able to filter events by clicking a date on the calendar widget or by entering a search term in the search bar. If there are no matching events, an alert will pop up and the page will redirect back to the home display.

#### Project Next Steps
- User login that allows users to save their favorites
- Currently the API does not return events in chronological order. We would like to find a way to display events in order and omit dates that have already passed, automatically removing those events or flagging them in the user's saved favorites.
